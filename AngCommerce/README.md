# AngCommerce

This is an implementation of this practice requirements exercises:

For the first exercise, try to accomplish the following:

1. Start a new project to build an ecommerce website.
2. Create a component to display a single product.
3. The product component should display a name, price, and image for the product.
   You can initialize the component with some defaults for the same. Use any placeholder
   image you want.
4. Highlight the entire element in a different color if the product is on sale. Whether
   the product is on sale can be an attribute of the product itself.
5. Add buttons to increase and decrease the quantity of the product in the cart. The
   quantity in the cart should be visible in the UI. Disable the button if the quantity
   is already zero.
