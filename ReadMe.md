# Learning Angular Concepts

## **Summary concepts**

This repo contains projects I build while learning various concepts in angular.

- Each commit description marks a section where I learnt a concept and the scope describing the application where it is implemented e.g `learn(stockApp): Implemented dependency injection`

- Each folder contains a project I build at a given stage of my learning process.

- Each folder has a ReadMe.md that explains about the project and how to get started with it.

- Each folder has a **notes.md** which highlights the notes made when learning the concepts.

## **Projects:**

- `APM` - A Product store management system to help get started with Angular JS

- `stock-market` - A stock market management app for futher learning of core angular concepts.
  _An implementation of a pdf linked in the project's ReadMe_

- `AngCommerce` - An ecommerce app to practice the concepts learnt while creating `stock-market` app.
  _An implementation of exercise files described in the projects ReadMe_

## **Getting Started**

### **Development server**

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### **Code scaffolding**

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### **Build**

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### **Running unit tests**

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### **Running end-to-end tests**

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### **Further help**

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
