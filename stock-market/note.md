# Intro

This are the key points I learnt while creating the stock market app using angular.

It is an implementation of a pdf angular course downloaded here: https://www.pdfdrive.com/angular-up-and-running-learning-angular-step-by-step-e176364392.html

### Event Binding and data flow

- `[]` - Square bracket notation for data binding
- `()` - Round bracket notation for event binding

Any time you see the square bracket notation, you can be
assured that it is data flowing from the component into the HTML. Any time you see
the parentheses notation, you are guaranteed that it refers to an event and flows from
a user action to the component.

### Using models for cleaner code

- They are a best practice to help us write cleaner code

- To generate a model skeleton class using angular we use:

`ng generate class <<folder/file-name>>`

## Directives

### Structural directives

Structural directives in Angular follow a very particular syntax, which makes it easy
to recognize when a directive is a structural directive versus a normal one.

All strutural
directives in Angular start with an asterisk (\*), like:

- `*ngIf` - Used for conditionally showing/hiding elements

- `*ngFor` - directive is used for creating multiple elements, usually one for each instance of
  some or the other object in an array

Instance variables avaiable with the \*ngFor directive:

- `index` - specifies the index of the current item.
- `even` - this is true when the item has an even index
- `odd` - true when the item has an odd index
- `first` - true when the item is the first item in the array
- `last` - true when the item is the last item in the array

* `trackBy` - used when we are going to reload the list (for example, loading it from an
  observable that makes a server call). It helps in
  performance:

- It takes a `trackByFunction` which should return the value by which to track items in the list

* `ngSwitch` - it is an attribute directive
  It contains:

- `ngSwitchCase` and `ngSwitchDefault` structural directives which add or remove elements based on the case

## Components

More on components:

### Selectors:

The selectors can be defined in various ways depeding on their use including:

- `selector: app-stock.html` - In this case the selector is used as `<app-stock-html></app-stock-html>`

- `.app-stock-html` - Would result in the selector being used as a css class like:

  `<div class="app-stock-html">`

- `[app-stock-html]` - would result in a selector being used as an attribute on a resulting item.

### Style Encapsulation

- `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` - Angular creates shimmed CSS to emulate the behavior that shadow DOMs and shadow roots provide.
- `ViewEncapsulation.Native` - Angular will use shadow roots. This will only work on browsers and platforms that natively support it.

- `ViewEncapsulation.None` - Uses global CSS, without any encapsulation.

e.g `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None` - allows the declared attributes in style to be shared through out the module

### Stripping white spaces

- Stripping white spaces helps reduce the bundle size by compressing the HTMl
- Set by using `preserveWhiteSpace:true/false` attribute on the component

### Animation

- Angular provides multiple triggers to control and animate each part of the component and its lifecycle

### interpolation

- Used to overide the default interpolation markers in angular
- By providing an array of 2 strings e.g:
  `interpolation: ["<<", ">>"]` to replace the interpolation symbols for that component

### View providers

- Allow you to define providers that inject classes/services into a
  component or any of its children

### changeDetection

- Enables us to control how and when angular updates the UI
  e.g We can overide the values from `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default` to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`
  i.e after the first render it will be up to us to let angular know when the value changes

### declarations

- It ensures that components and modules are available for use within the scope of the module

### imports

- Allows you to specify attributes that you want imported and accessible through your module

### exports

- Relevant when you have multiple modules or you need to create a module that will be used by other developers

## Decorators

### Input

Automatically allows you
to pass in values to the component for that particular input via Angularâ€™s data binding syntax.

### Change Detection Strategy:

Defines how the components respond to a change in the parect/child component

example: `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`

### Component Lifecycle

The methods are called in the following order:

- **constructor**()
- **ngOnChanges**()
- **ngOnInit**()
- **ngDoCheck**()

  **ngAfterContentInit**()
  **ngAfterContentChecked()**
  **ngAfterViewInit()**
  **ngAfterViewChecked()**

- **ngOnDestroy**

The various interfaces must be implemented alongside with the lifecycle hooks

### ViewChildren

It is any child component whose tags/selectors appear within the template of the component

### ContentChildren

Any child component that gets projected into the view of the
ContentChildren
component, but is not directly included in the template within the component

### Component Projection

Projection is useful when we want to build components but set some parts of the UI
of the component to not be an innate part of it.
